# Fullstack frontend

This repo is supposed to provide as a boilerplate for doing routing using [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo)

This site is deployed at https://roomy-fact.surge.sh

## Running the project

Make sure you have [Open Live Server](https://github.com/behu-kea/navigo-routing-simple) installed

In the bottom right corner click the `Go live` button. That should give you a url like http://127.0.0.1:5500/
